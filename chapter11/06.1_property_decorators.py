# You are building a class to manage a Student's academic record. The Student class should store the studentâ€™s birth_year and calculate their age based on the current year. However, the age should always be computed dynamically, and the birth_year should not be directly modified after being set.

# Implement a Student class where:
# The birth_year is a private attribute that can be set only once during initialization, and it cannot be changed after that.
# The age is a computed property based on the current year and the birth_year. This property should be updated dynamically every time it is accessed.
# The birth_year should not be accessed directly from outside the class but should be accessed and set through the birth_year property.

# Constraints:

# Ensure that the age is computed based on the current year.

# If someone tries to modify birth_year after initialization, it should raise an exception.

# The class should also handle cases where birth_year might be invalid (like a year in the future).
